2 - You want to create your own typeface. First, download all the fills. You can print the grid the complete it, or you can directly work on a typographic creation software (for example Glyphs or Fontlab). Then, you fill find the rules and different examples of typesfaces in a pdf. Now all you have to do is start the work! When you have finished your own typeface, send me its names and the fills to share it on GitHub :-)
